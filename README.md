# Calculator-
A semi-professional calculator created with python
Primary Application
The program can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.-Additionally,
it can perform inbuilt Python calculations like modulo and floor division

Long Term Goal
The program can perform advanced trigonometric operations such as sine, cosine, and tangent angles.

Overview of Project
Import modules(tkinter, math)
Main GUI Window Setup(Title, geometry) – A Tkinter window is created and the name is set to ‘Calculator’
Entry Widget Setup(Text field) - An Entry widget is created to display inputs and results
Button Functions Setup (Numeric, operations, and special buttons)
	-Numeric function is called when a number between 0-9 is pressed
	-Special buttons like ‘clear’, ‘Off’, and ‘Equal’ are called when their keys are pressed
	- Math Operations functions are called when (+, -, /,//, *) keys are pressed
	- Trigonometric functions to convert input to radians
Buttons Setup (Grid position, name, color, command)
Main Event Loop

Flow of Execution
Users will use the Entry widget to input digits and mathematical operations
- The Program will perform the calculations using defined functions
- The program will display the results on the Entry widget
